# Web3.js Demo dApp Templates

The projects in this folder demonstrate using Web3.js with various front-end
frameworks. They include Web3.js as a dependency and expose a
[Web3](https://docs.web3js.org/api/web3/class/Web3) instance that is created
with an
[injected provider](https://docs.web3js.org/guides/web3_providers_guide/#injected-provider).
These templates are designed to showcase how Web3.js can be used to build dApps.
Refer to the [minimal templates](../min) for simple starter projects with less
boilerplate.
