# Web3.js Minimal dApp Templates

The projects in this folder are minimal templates for using Web3.js with various
front-end frameworks. They include Web3.js as a dependency and expose a
[Web3](https://docs.web3js.org/api/web3/class/Web3) instance that is created
with an
[injected provider](https://docs.web3js.org/guides/web3_providers_guide/#injected-provider).
These templates are designed for users that want to build their own dApp without
the need to remove unnecessary boilerplate code. Refer to the
[demo templates](../demo) for fully featured examples of using Web3.js from the
browser.
